# Descriptions  
Actually, this is the course that guides me to the world of Computer Science. I don't know how to finish the optional labs when I started learning this course, but now after the study of CS61A, I come back and try to finish all the optional labs on my own. And this is the reason why all notes you see in this repo were created a half year ago before this repo is created.
